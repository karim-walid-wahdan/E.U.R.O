# E.U.R.O

This repository contains the Elecrtical Unidentified Robotic Object (E.U.R.O) project 
which is a embeded system robot developed as part of the embdeded systems course at the German University in Cairo, under the supervision of Dr. Hassan soubra. 

## About

The E.U.R.O project aims to demonstrate the various principles of embeded systems and real time operating systems (RTOS) by providing 4 different functionalties with multiple priorties and how an embeded system equipped with RTOS can handle tasks depending on thier priorty   

## Repository Contents

- `E.U.R.O.ino`: the arduino file representing the robot algorthim embededd with RTOS functionality
- `ProjectReport.docx`: A report of the design of the of the robot and its functionality 


## Installation

   ```

2. Install Arduino
   
3. Burn the E.U.R.O.ino on your choice of an arduino board
