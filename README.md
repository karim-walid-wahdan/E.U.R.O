# E.U.R.O

This repository contains the Electrical Unidentified Robotic Object (E.U.R.O) project 
which is an embedded system robot developed as part of the embedded systems course at the German University in Cairo, under the supervision of Dr. Hassan Soubra. 

## About

The E.U.R.O project aims to demonstrate the various principles of embedded systems and real-time operating systems (RTOS) by providing 4 different functionalities with multiple priorities and how an embedded system equipped with RTOS can handle tasks depending on their priority   

## Repository Contents

- `E.U.R.O.ino`: the Arduino file representing the robot algorithm embedded with RTOS functionality
- `ProjectReport.docx`: A report on the design of the robot and its functionality
